## Setting Up a React.js Project

Follow these steps to set up a React.js project:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

### Installing React.js dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have your React.js project. Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server and see your React.js app in action, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open your app in a browser window. By default, it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

Once you're satisfied with your React app, you can build it for production. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory if you are not already there. Run the following command to create a production-ready build:

```
npm run build
```

This command will create an optimized and minified version of your app in the `build` folder.
